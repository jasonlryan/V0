# HomeTruth Project Documentation: Next Steps

## 1. Refine and Confirm Sitemap and Navigation Structure

### Sitemap Development

- **Objective**: Design a sitemap that prioritizes easy access to core features: the AI Property Knowledgebase, Document Vault, and Saved Insights.
- **Structure**:
  - Ensure the **Knowledgebase** is prominently accessible, as it is the main attraction for all user types.
  - Create a straightforward layout that includes:
    - **Home**
    - **Document Vault** (for secure document storage)
    - **Saved Insights** (for users to save and organize insights)
    - **Upgrade to Pro** prompt for easy conversion to premium features.
- **User-Specific Navigation**:
  - **Guest Users**: Should have immediate access to the knowledge base without needing an account.
  - **Registered Users**: Provide clear access to document uploading and saved insights, promoting the value of personalized features.
  - **Pro Subscribers**: Emphasize enhanced features, like additional document storage, insights, and exclusive content.

### Navigation Review

- Ensure that the navigation is intuitive, easy to follow, and minimizes steps for accessing key features.
- Place call-to-action (CTA) buttons in visible areas to promote actions such as upgrading, uploading documents, and accessing saved insights.
