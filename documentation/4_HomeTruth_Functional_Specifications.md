# 4. Functional Specifications and System Behavior

## AI Integration Points

- **Objective**: Define AI behavior for combining general and user-specific data.
  - Ensure the AI assistant can access and integrate information from both the **Knowledgebase** and **user-uploaded documents**.
  - Develop personalized response capabilities based on user-specific data for improved engagement.

## Document Handling & OCR Specifications

- Set parameters for OCR functionality:
  - **Accuracy**: Aim for high OCR accuracy with standard document types (e.g., PDFs, images of documents).
  - **Error Handling**: Define error responses for low-quality uploads (e.g., provide feedback on re-uploading with better resolution).
  - **Processing Time**: Ensure quick processing, displaying a loading indicator if it takes more than a few seconds.

## Error Handling

- **Objective**: Provide clear feedback for unsuccessful actions.
  - **Document Upload Failures**: If an upload fails due to format or quality issues, provide specific guidance on acceptable formats or tips for improving image quality.
  - **Subscription Payment Issues**: If a payment fails, prompt users with an error message and steps for retrying or updating payment information.
