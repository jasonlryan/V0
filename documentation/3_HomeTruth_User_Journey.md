# 3. User Journey Mapping and App Flow

## Detailed Journey Mapping

- **Objective**: Outline specific paths for each user type (Guest, Registered, Subscriber).
  - **Guest User**: Can explore the knowledge base without an account, with subtle prompts to register for enhanced features.
  - **Registered User**: Gains access to personalized content such as saved insights and document uploading after sign-up.
  - **Subscriber**: Receives full access to Pro features, including document storage, AI-powered insights, and priority support.

## Onboarding and Call-to-Actions (CTAs)

- Add tooltips and prompts to guide new users, especially in areas like:
  - **Document Upload**: Explain the benefits of uploading documents for personalized insights.
  - **AI Interaction**: Provide hints on how to ask questions for personalized responses.
  - **Insights Saving**: Encourage saving insights for easy future reference.

## Subscription Upsell Points

- Ensure that the upgrade prompts on the "Saved Insights" and "Document Vault" screens are visible but non-intrusive.
- Use in-app messages or banners to promote the benefits of Pro features (e.g., additional storage, enhanced AI insights).
