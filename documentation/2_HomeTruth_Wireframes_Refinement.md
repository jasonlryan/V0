# 2. Wireframes Analysis and Refinement

## Visual Hierarchy

- **Objective**: Prioritize key features visually to ensure ease of access.
  - Highlight "Upgrade to Pro" prominently, especially in **Document Vault** and **Saved Insights** screens.
  - Clearly display the **document upload** option in the Document Vault to guide new users.
  - Ensure that the **Knowledgebase** is easy to access and visually distinct as a core feature.

## Feature Layout

- Review the layout of **Saved Insights** and **Document Vault** to ensure they are easily understood by first-time users.
- Consider adding brief explanatory text or icons to guide users in using these features effectively.

## Responsive Design Considerations

- Validate that the wireframes are designed for both desktop and mobile formats.
- Ensure consistent user experience across devices, with key elements like navigation, upload buttons, and upgrade prompts adapting effectively on smaller screens.
