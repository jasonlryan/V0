# 6. Iterative Testing and Feedback Collection

## Usability Testing

- **Objective**: Conduct usability testing sessions focusing on the ease of navigation, document uploading, and AI assistant interactions.
  - Evaluate users' ability to find and use the **Document Vault** and **Saved Insights**.
  - Collect feedback on ease of navigation, accessibility, and overall flow.
  - Test interactions with the AI assistant for both general questions and personalized responses based on uploaded documents.

## Feedback Loops

- Establish feedback mechanisms to capture user insights post-launch.
  - Include surveys or feedback forms within the **Saved Insights**, **Document Vault**, and **Knowledgebase** sections.
  - Analyze feedback to inform future iterations, especially around areas like document management, AI interactions, and Pro feature engagement.
